***********
API changelog and releases
***********

The default versioning system is 1.x, where changes in the major number
indicates that the API has been modified significantly, and the code examples
or tests needed to be changed drastically to reflect that. Minor version changes
usually add functionality and retain backwards compatibility in the same major
number (mostly).
